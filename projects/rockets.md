This project is composed of a Laravel back-end and a separate Vue.js front-end. The Laravel project seeds play-by-play data for NBA games into a MySQL database, and creates an API to interact with the data. The front-end portion caches player stats from the API and uses Highcharts to display various stats for players (Rockets only).
